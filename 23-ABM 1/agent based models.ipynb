    "# Schelling Segregation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background (from Mesa example)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a random available grid space. While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\"\n",

Schelling won a Nobel Prize in 2005 for \"having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis\".  His work was applied to strategies of conflict and arms control during the Cold War, and to understanding residential housing segregation, as noted here.  \n",

First you understand big-picture what your code needs to do, and outline the methods.  Only after you get the signatures and basics set up, do you dive into the details of how to make them do those things.  This is a way to avoid getting lost in the weeds too soon.  I recommend you use it when practical."
