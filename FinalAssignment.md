**Assignment**

The final assignment for this class is to apply the skills you learn in this class to ask and answer a research question related to transport.  Your project will follow the guidance for [*Transport Findings*](https://transportfindings.org/).  Specifically, it should: 

1. Include a clearly articulated research question.   
2. A valid and replicable methodology for answering that question.  In practical terms, this means that any code you write needs to be clean, transparent, and something that a competent reviewer can run. 
3. Some resulting finding.  

Your project does not need an extensive literature review, background or theory development.  The specific topic is wide open, and up to you to choose.  For inspiration, you may wish to browse the current articles.  Promising papers can be submitted to the journal in consultation with your advisor and the course instructor.  

The project will include three deliverables: 

1. A written paper of no more than 1000 words, no more than 3 figures and no more than 3 tables, in the *Transport Findings* format.
2. An oral presentation following the same format as the paper.  
3. Code and data uploaded to github such that another user can reproduce your finding. 

To make sure you have selected an appropriate topic, you will do a 10-minute oral proposal, followed by a question and answer session.  All students should come prepared to ask constructive questions of all proposers.  You must discuss your idea with Dr. Erhardt during office hours, prior to the proposal.  The proposal must articulate your research question and propose a methodology to answer that question.  

A mid-point check is is due as noted above.  You  must review your code and progress with Dr. Erhardt during office hours.  You should come prepared with a work breakdown structure showing the remaining steps.
