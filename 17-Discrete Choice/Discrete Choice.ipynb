    "# Discrete Choice Modeling\n",

    "Koppelman & Bhat (2006) A Self-Instructing Course in Mode Choice Modeling\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything has a continous dependent variable.  Some things are discrete.  Coke or Pepsi?  Soda or pop?  Let's think of a few...\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete choice models give us a way to model this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "In this framework, there are several elements to the choice decision process: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The decision maker\n",
    "- The alternatives\n",
    "- Attributes of the alternatives\n",
    "- The decision rule\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a multi-nomial logit (MNL) model.  It takes the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(i) = \\frac{e^{U_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{J} e^{U_j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_i = \\beta X_i + \\epsilon_i$ and $\\epsilon_i$ follows a Gumbel distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This equation defines the decision rule.  A bit of time to work it through...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Will be using [Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/).  Start with: \n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install statsmodels\n",
